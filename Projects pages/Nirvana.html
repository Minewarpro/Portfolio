                <div class="gif-container">
                    <p>The concept of this game is simple yet original. We play in first person in a mystical universe. It's a fast-paced FPS but with the particularity of bullet hell.
                        That means there's a large number of projectiles on the screen, formed with specific patterns. The goal is to dodge them while killing enemies.</p>

                <h2>● 3C</h2>

                <p>The keyword for the 3Cs is "intentions." We have chosen to create a very dynamic game focused on movement.</p>
                <p>To address this issue, we have chosen to offer a wide range of movement options available to the player, as shown in the GIF below. </p>


                <div class="gif-container">

                    <div class="gif-info">
                        <h3>Mouvement</h3>
                        <p>- Double Dash</p>
                        <p>- Slide </p>
                        <p>- Mantle</p>
                        <p>- Double jump</p>
                        <p>- High move speed </p>

                        <h3>Dash</h3>
                        <p>The dash is perhaps the movement ability that the player will use the most during their game. Therefore, it is crucial that it is well thought out.</p>
                        <p>We opted for two charges to allow the player to choose whether to consume both in succession to go faster or to use only one for more precision.</p>
                        <p>The dash is only on the horizontal axis but can move sideways or forwards/backwards to allow the player to more easily dodge projectiles.</p>

                    <h3>Slide</h3>
                    <p>The slide is the ability to move that allows you to gain the most speed in the game.</p>
                    <p>If you slide down a slope, it continues your slide until the end of it.</p>
                    <p>If you jump during the slide, you gain a speed and height boost on your jump. It's useful for experienced players who want to optimize their movement</p>
                    <p>The slide is useful for fast movement, but it can be punishing if used incorrectly in combat. However, it can also be an asset for dodging certain projectile patterns.</p>

                    <div class="gif-info">
                        <p>In the game, all elements with the weathered wood texture can be broken by sending our ball towards them.</p>
                        <p>It is also possible to grab crates to throw and break them.</p>
                    </div>

                <h2>● The Player</h2>
                <p>Managing the player was also a challenge. In Unreal Engine, the default character is derived from the <strong>"Character"</strong> class, which uses <strong>"Character Movement"</strong>.
                    The problem with this is that it ignores physical constraints that are not predefined within it. Unfortunately, the system mentioned earlier did not work in this case.</p>
                <p>The solution I found is to use the parent class <strong>"Pawn"</strong> and employ another movement management system, <strong>"FloatingPawnMovement"</strong>, which is much more permissive.</p>

                <div class="details-img"> <img src="../Image/PawnCharacter.jpg" alt="PawnCharacter"> </div>

                <h3>The counterparts</h3>
                <p>The counterpart of this is that there are many features that don't exist, and we have to code them ourselves.</p>
                <p>For example, we could mention the management of <strong>gravity</strong>, the <strong>Jump</strong> function, or even the <strong>On Landed </strong>event,
                    which allows the detection of the player when they touch the ground.</p>
